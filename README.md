### MuleChain Vectors Extension

MAC Vectors provides access to a broad number of external Vector Stores and Databases. It is built to be leveraged by the MAC Projects AI Connectors.


### Requirements

- The maximum supported version for Java SDK is JDK 17. You can use JDK 17 only for running your application.
- Compilation with Java SDK must be done with JDK 8.


### Installation (using Cloud.Anypoint Dependency)

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>cloud.anypoint</groupId>
   <artifactId>mule-vectors-connector</artifactId>
   <version>0.2.0</version>
   <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Installation (building locally)

To use this connector, first [build and install](https://mac-project.ai/docs/mulechain-ai/getting-started) the connector into your local maven repository.
Then add the following dependency to your application's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule4-vectors-connector</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Installation into private Anypoint Exchange

You can also make this connector available as an asset in your Anyooint Exchange.

This process will require you to build the connector as above, but additionally you will need
to make some changes to the `pom.xml`.  For this reason, we recommend you fork the repository.

Then, follow the MuleSoft [documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/to-publish-assets-maven) to modify and publish the asset.
